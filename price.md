Note: For the currency conversion, I've used historical price ratios and the D20 SRD pricing as guidelines, and adjusted to match your currency system. Where Document 1 had items that were functionally included in Document 2 but with different names or categories, I've added appropriate new entries to maintain consistency with your pricing structure.
