        <h1>Token-Based School Choice with Externality Pricing</h1>
        <p>A VCG-inspired approach to school allocation that maintains strategy-proofness</p>
    </header>
    
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>School choice mechanisms need to balance multiple objectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Allocating students to schools to maximize overall welfare</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy-proofness</strong>: Ensuring students have incentives to report preferences truthfully</li>
                <li><strong>Priorities</strong>: Accommodating important considerations like siblings, neighborhoods, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Traditional approaches like Deferred Acceptance ensure stability and strategy-proofness but may sacrifice efficiency. VCG mechanisms achieve efficiency and strategy-proofness but typically require monetary transfers.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Our Solution: Tokens + School-Specific Externalities</h2>
            <p>We (Well I but you get the picture) propose a mechanism that combines:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A <span class="highlight">token-based pseudomarket</span> where students "bid" on schools</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">School-specific externality pricing</span> to set token costs</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Priority bonuses</span> to accommodate important practical considerations</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="flow-diagram">
                <div class="flow-step">Equal base token allocation to all students</div>
                <div class="flow-step">Priority bonuses added as extra tokens for specific schools</div>
                <div class="flow-step">School-specific externality calculations to determine token costs</div>
                <div class="flow-step">Students submit preferences and token allocations</div>
                <div class="flow-step">Optimal matching computed based on preferences and tokens</div>
            </div>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Key Components</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Token Allocation</h3>
            <p>Each student receives an equal base allocation of tokens to bid on schools. This promotes fairness while enabling preference expression.</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Each student receives 100 base tokens.
                <div>
                    <div class="token">1</div>
                    <div class="token">1</div>
                    <div class="token">1</div>
                    <span>...</span>
                    <div class="token">1</div>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>2. Priority Bonuses</h3>
            <p>Students with priorities receive additional tokens specifically for eligible schools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sibling at a school: +X tokens for that school</li>
                <li>Neighborhood priority: +Y tokens for zoned school</li>
                <li>Special needs: +Z tokens for schools with appropriate programs</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. School-Specific Externality Pricing</h3>
            <p>The token cost for each student-school pair reflects the externality (welfare loss to others) if that student attends that school.</p>
            
            <div class="algorithm">
                <strong>For each student i and school s:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Calculate social welfare when student i is assigned to school s</li>
                    <li>Calculate social welfare when student i is NOT assigned to school s</li>
                    <li>The difference represents the externality that i imposes on others by attending s</li>
                    <li>Set token cost based on this externality</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>The Algorithm in Detail</h2>
            
            <h3>Initialization Phase</h3>
            <pre>
1. Collect student preferences (rank-ordered list of schools)
2. Assign base tokens to all students (e.g., 100 tokens each)
3. Calculate and assign priority bonuses
   • For each priority type (sibling, neighborhood, etc.)
   • Add school-specific bonus tokens to eligible students
            </pre>
            
            <h3>Externality Calculation Phase</h3>
            <pre>
1. For each student i:
   a. For each school s:
      i. Compute optimal allocation with student i assigned to s
      ii. Compute optimal allocation with student i NOT assigned to s
      iii. Calculate welfare difference = externality
      iv. Set token cost for student i at school s based on externality

2. Matrix of costs:
   • Each student has potentially different token costs for each school
   • Higher-demand schools naturally have higher costs
            </pre>
            
            <h3>Allocation Phase</h3>
            <pre>
1. Students allocate their tokens across schools based on preferences
2. System computes clearing allocation maximizing total welfare
3. Each student is assigned to exactly one school
            </pre>
            
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example Calculation:</strong>
                <p>If Student A attending School X would prevent 3 other students from attending their 2nd choice (utility drop of 5 each), the externality = 15 tokens.</p>

            <h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>
            
            <h3>Computational Aspects</h3>
            <p>While calculating all externalities may seem intensive, modern computational tools make this feasible:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-compute externality matrices during planning phase</li>
                <li>Use parallel processing for different student-school combinations</li>
                <li>Implement incremental updating to avoid full recalculations</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Calibrating Priority Bonuses</h3>
            <p>The bonus tokens must be calibrated carefully:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Too few: Priorities aren't meaningfully respected</li>
                <li>Too many: System becomes effectively a pure priority system</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Data from previous years can help calibrate these values appropriately.</p>
            
            <h3>User Interface</h3>
            <p>Students and families need a clear interface to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>See their total tokens, including priority bonuses</li>
                <li>View token costs for each school</li>
                <li>Allocate tokens across preferred schools</li>
                <li>Understand the final allocation and reasoning</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Code Implementation</h2>
            <p>Below is a complete Python implementation of the token-based school choice mechanism with externality pricing using Gurobi. This code demonstrates how to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set up the problem with students, schools, and priorities</li>
                <li>Calculate school-specific externalities</li>
                <li>Formulate and solve the optimization problem</li>
                <li>Report the results of the allocation</li>
            </ul>
